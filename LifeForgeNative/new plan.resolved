# Implementation Plan: UI Polish & Sign-Up Validation

## User Review Required
> [!IMPORTANT]
> I will be refactoring the "Your Apps" / "Managed Apps" sections in Dashboard and Guardian to match specific styles requested (Forge Push-up style and Guardian Shield style respectively). This will change the layout of these lists significantly.

## Proposed Changes

### [Dashboard]
#### [MODIFY] [DashboardScreen.kt](file:///d:/stoppy/LifeForgeNative/app/src/main/java/com/lifeforge/app/ui/screens/dashboard/DashboardScreen.kt)
- **Daily Insight**: Remove the top header Row (Icon + "DAILY INSIGHT"). Keep only the quote text centered in the transparent GlassCard.
- **Your Apps**:
    - Improve spacing for app icons/details.
    - get the glow or the glass refernce from the "Shield offilne" card style don't change the layout only the glass logic copy it not the layout 

### [Guardian]
#### [MODIFY] [GuardianScreen.kt](file:///d:/stoppy/LifeForgeNative/app/src/main/java/com/lifeforge/app/ui/screens/guardian/GuardianScreen.kt)
- **Managed Apps**: Update the container/items to use the "Shield Offline" card style (`GlassCard -> Row(IconBox -> TextColumn -> Action)`).

### [Settings]
#### [MODIFY] [SettingsScreen.kt](file:///d:/stoppy/LifeForgeNative/app/src/main/java/com/lifeforge/app/ui/screens/settings/SettingsScreen.kt)
- **All Settings Boxes**: Refactor settings items to match the "Shield Offline" card style.

### [Auth]
#### [MODIFY] [AuthScreen.kt](file:///d:/stoppy/LifeForgeNative/app/src/main/java/com/lifeforge/app/ui/screens/auth/AuthScreen.kt)
- **Validation**: Implement robust input validation before calling `viewModel.signUp`.
    - Check for spaces in email and show "No spaces allowed".
    - Check for empty fields.
    - Check for simple email regex.
- **Error Handling**: Display these validation errors via the existing Snackbar or a new `isError` state on text fields for better UX.

## Verification Plan
- **Daily Insight**: Verify only the quote appears in a clean box.
- **Your Apps**: Verify the style matches the Forge cards.
- **Guardian/Settings**: Verify cards look consistent with the Shield Status card.
- **Sign Up**: Try entering " " in email -> Expect "No spaces allowed" formatted error. Try duplicate ID -> Expect Supabase error to be shown gracefully.
